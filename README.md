# Virtual computer system

The following is my attempt at the following set of exercises: https://github.com/bitfield/gmachine/blob/master/README.md

The goal of this small project is to get more familiar with working in the TDD flow using Golang.

## Goals

- Get more familiar with writing tests in Go. Keep testing behaviours top of mind
- Create a package that is able to be imported by an external user to use within their project
- Get comfortable using more of Golang's syntax and contructs to build a small program
